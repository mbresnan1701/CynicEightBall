# CynicEightBall

This was a weekend project. Nothing special, not going to make PHAT STACKZ off it. I just wanted to spend some time getting familiar with play store deployments. 

It's a magic eight ball, with all the accuracy of a real magic eight ball, without the embarassement of actually owning a magic eight ball. Comes with 100% more insults! Basically, you use it like a regular magic eight ball, and instead of a prophecy, it just returns insults to the user. 

Free free to steal my code, pass this off as your own work, whatever. I don't care.
